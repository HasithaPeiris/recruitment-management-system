# Recruitment Management System
We have developed a Recruitment Management System as a web-based application for our university project. It simplifies and streamlines the recruitment process for organizations. With a focus on usability, we implemented CRUD operations using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

Key features include efficient job vacancy management, applicant tracking, resume submission, real-time application status tracking, interview scheduling, applicant evaluation, and feedback, as well as comprehensive reporting and analytics.

Our system stands as a testament to our teamwork and technical skills. It provides organizations with an intuitive and efficient solution for managing their recruitment process. The project showcases our expertise in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with backend programming using PHP and database management with MySQL.
